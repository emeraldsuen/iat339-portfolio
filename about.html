        I am Karmen Suen, a user experience and graphic design student at Simon Fraser Universityâ€™s Interactive Arts and Technology program, which marries the three disciplines of media arts, design, and interactive systems. I am passionate about
        all forms of design, however, my focus is to design for clarity, simplicity, and accessibility in my work. Good design is the unification of form and function. Both of these things is what makes design what it is. Form: it has to look
        aesthetic. Function: it has to serve its purpose.I believe in a user-centric design that
        can be adaptable for even the smallest percentage of the population.
